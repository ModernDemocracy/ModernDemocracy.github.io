title: Legislature
---

The Legislature exists to govern the nation. Legislatures around the world have evolved over time, usually beginning as ogliarchic bodies filled with aristocrats, and slowly transformed over time into more representative and democratic bodies.

Representative government has evolved as an effective method of ensuring a governing body accurately reflects the opinions and values of those it governs.

While in many countries these legislative bodies do an adequate task for representing the citzens of their nations, there can always be room for improvements.

#Problems
There are a number of issues with representitive bodies as they currently function. It is almost impossible to introduce a change or a law that would benefit the nation but may disadvantage the representitives in the legislature. Or inversely, legislatures often pass laws that benefit it's members but do not benefit the nation or it's people.

In many countries it is not uncommon for politicians and political parties to pass laws to make it more difficult for new parties to arise and to be elected. This anti-competitive behaviour degrades the quality of democratic representation in a nation. These kinds of laws can include making party registration particuarly onerous, or setting higher administrative or bureaucratic hurdles.

Other examples include: 

* Enforcing conflict of interest rules where representitives are passing laws that directly impact companies they own, or the business ventures of their friends or family.
* Representitives typically determine their own renumeration, over time leading to few checks on the growth of their pay.
* The representitives that get elected are typically those who are the best public speakers, not those who best represent the public.
* Represetitives often and easily lie to the public to gain support from the electorate.

#Solution?
Just because most democratic governments are made up of (mostly elected) representatives, does not mean this is the most ideal system to accurately represent the views and values of a governed people.

Ancient Greece, often considered to be the birthplace of democracy in fact used a system called sortition. This is similar to the system of juries used in many countries today. Members of their governing bodies were chosen from a group of randomly selected citizens (at the time, all male and land holding). This was considered to be a core feature of democracy (rule by the people) and stood in contrast to rule of the few (ogliarchy).

##House of Jurors
In supplement to an elected body of representitives, (often referred to as the Lower House, House of Representatives, House of Commons, or Congress) the legislative branch of government would include a House of Jurors or Citizen's Assembly.

###Selection and duties
This House of Jurors would be made up of a representitive sample of the population. For a country with a population in the millions, less than 400 randomly selected people is sufficient for a representitive sample of the population assuming a 95% confidence level and 5% margin of error.

Every session of the legislature, one third of the jurors would be replaced, thus a Juror's term would last for three sessions of the legislature. The house of Jurors would not be replaced all at once, this allows a majority of the House to always be familiar with the current activities of government and laws under debate.

Jurors would be randomly selected from a pool of eligble citizens. Some criteria for what constitutes a citizen to be eligible as a Juror:

* Is of legal adult age.
* Is legally entitled to vote.
* Has not served in the House of Jurors in the last 3 years.

However not everyone can make time to be available to serve in the legislature, and allowances can be made to excuse people who meet sufficient criteria such as:

* Medical issues
* Disability
* Scheduled holidays
* Berevement leave
* Are the only carer of someone

###Powers and Responsibilities
The House of Jurors would fufill the 'house of review' role many Upper Houses of legislatures currently fill. However a House of Jurors circumvents many of the issues of representitives, including the very idea of having representitives chosen to review and counterbalance other representitives.

All laws would need to be passed by both the House of Representitives and the House of Jurors. Both Houses can also propose laws to be debated and passed by the legislature. Additionally, the House of Jurors could be given the power to investigate corruption and misconduct that occurs in the House of Representitives, and if necessary the House of Representitives could be given the power to investigate corruption and misconduct in the House of Jurors.

Because the House of Jurors is not beholden to the political interests of the House of Representitive they are more likely to investigate corruption and misconduct even if it would be politically inconvenient.

###Benefits
Requrying all legislation to pass both houses of government leads to a number of positive outcomes.

####Laws that are clearly only to the benefit for the elected representitives are much more difficult to pass, and much easier to repeal.
Very often elected governments will pass laws that typically only benefit themselves. These laws can range from mostly harmless things like pay raises for elected members to damaging changes to a nation's democracy like restrictions of the numbers or types of people and parties that can be elected, often leading to parties entrenching themselves into government and excluding other voices and opinions of the people.

Jurors have no obligation to a particular party making passing laws that only benefit the entrenched parties much more difficult, and much more likely to be rejected or at the very least ammended to be less harmfull.

####Opinions and values of the general public are more likely to be represented even if they run contrary to the interests of a nation's political class.
In most countries the political elites and elected representitives rarely reflect the varied economic, racial, gender, or professional makeup of a nation. In western countries like America, the United Kingdom or Australia, politicians are usually some combination of upper class or wealthy, white, male, straight, and a lawyer. While those demographics all certainly deserve representation in government, so do all the other people who have different ethnicities, professions or jobs, genders, or sexualities.

The Jury will by its very nature be more representitive of the nation at large and give a political voice to people who would rarely otherwise have political representation.

####Jurors are much less likely to be corrupt and the lasting impact of any corruption is less significant.
Jurors are only members of government for a limited time, creating less opportunities for any corrupting influence to take effect. Even if a Juror was to take bribes or fall under the influence of an outside party, once their term is up they are no longer part of the legislature, unlike a representitive who can continue to get re-elected.

Also due to their shorter service buying the influence of a Juror is less valuable. Corrupting a representitive on the othe rhand can provide an outside party continued influence in government.


#Why keep representitives at all?
Representitive democracy has it's benefits, and it is not desirable to remove them entirely.

For example:

* Having people professionally working as a representitive full time allows them to learn the specifics and intricacies of an issue.
* Merely by volunteering for the position they are more likely to have a vested interest in the issues that are being discussed and debated.

However adding sortition or citizen juries to work alongside a representive government would help make the government much more reflective of the people they govern.

#Disadvantages
While a Jury solves a number of problems that exist with a representitive government, it does raise a few concerns with the public.

Below answers for a number of common concerns are shown. 

###What if a crazy/inappropriate person gets chosen?
A common concern is that someone who is not suitable for the role will get selected. These concerns can range from mental illness, extreme political opions or a history of criminal activity.

Issues like these are not typically going to be a concern, even if someone with such characteristics is chosen, they will only number a few of the total selected Jurors. Many Jurors will even prefer to be excused if they have medical issues or mental instabilities, someone with a serious mental health condition may not even be eligible to be on the Jury. Additionally, these issues can easily be mitigated where necessary by the legislature enforcing appropriate restrictions of Jury eligibility.

###No one wants to be forced to join a Jury.
Just like Juries in many common law nations, it is a regular cultural theme that citizens do not want to be forced to do jury duty, seeing it as an inconvenient interruption of their lives or loss of income.

This is a fair argument however the nature of serving in the House of Jurors differs to jury duty in a court of law.

* The period of service is definite and can be organised months in advance allowing time to prepare.
* Jurors would be payed for their service the same as other members of the legislature (who are typically compensated well in excess of the average citizen's income).
* Jurors will not typically be required to perform their duties in the legislature every day, leading to less distruption to their everyday lives.

###How will everyone in the Jury meet in the capital and live there for their term?
One of the big reasons why Athenian sortition never spread beyond the city level of government was due to technological limitations of the time. 

This is also a strong factor in the popularity of representitive government around the world, having all people in a nation meet to discuss laws is impractical and undesirable.

In a modern democracy however, we have the technology to allow individuals from across the world to talk to one another in real time. Jurors would not need to travel all the way to the seat of their government in order to fufill their Juror's responsibilities.

Instead it can easily be arranged for Jurors to participate in debate and discussion via videoconference.
